# SO2IC SERVER

server for the so2ic implementation

## Purpose

This is the server for the Shards Of Inifinity In C implementation. Shards of Infinty is a deckbuilding game that you could see [here](https://iello.fr/jeux/shards-of-infinity/). \
The purpose of this reimplementation in C is to challenge me a bit by making a client server game in pure C. Actually, the goal is to learn as much as I can in C :). \
If this project ever come to an end (100% impossible) I would like to make an algorithm/AI to play against me so I can play everywhere at any time. \
Finally, if I can use those 'bots' to make some probability about the game like a card tierlist it could be cool.

## Requirement

- *make*
- *clang* / *gcc*

## Usage

- build using `make`
- run `./bin/exe`
